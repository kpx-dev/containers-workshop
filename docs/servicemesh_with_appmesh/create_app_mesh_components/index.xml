      <title>About Sidecars</title>

      <description>As decoupled logic, an App Mesh sidecar container must run alongside each pod in the DJ App deployment.
This can be setup in few different ways:
 Before installing the deployment, we could modify the DJ App deployment&amp;rsquo;s container specs to include App Mesh sidecar containers. When deployed, it would run the sidecar.
 After installing the deployment, we could patch the deployment to include the sidecar container specs. Upon applying this patch, the old pods would be torn down, and the new pods would come up with the sidecar.</description>

      <title>Creating the Injector Controller</title>

      <description>To create the injector controller, we&amp;rsquo;ll run a script that creates a namespace, generates certificates, and then installs the injector deployment.
From the base repository directory, change into the injector directory:
cd 2_create_injector  Next, run the create.sh script:
./create.sh  Output should look similar to:
namespace/appmesh-inject created creating certs in tmpdir /var/folders/02/qfw6pbm501xbw4scnk20w80h0_xvht/T/tmp.LFO95khQ Generating RSA private key, 2048 bit long modulus .........+++ ..............................+++ e is 65537 (0x10001) certificatesigningrequest.certificates.k8s.io/aws-app-mesh-inject.appmesh-inject created NAME AGE REQUESTOR CONDITION aws-app-mesh-inject.</description>

      <title>Define the Injector Targets</title>

      <description>By default, the injector won&amp;rsquo;t act on any pods — we&amp;rsquo;ll need to give it criteria on what its auto-inject targets should be.
For the purpose of this tutorial, we&amp;rsquo;ll make it inject the App Mesh sidecar into any new pods created in the prod namespace. To do that, we&amp;rsquo;ll label our prod namespace with appmesh.k8s.aws/sidecarInjectorWebhook=enabled.
Return to the repo&amp;rsquo;s base dir:
cd ..  And run the following command to label the prod namespace:</description>

      <title>Adding the CRDs</title>

      <description>There are two ways to create the components of the App Mesh service mesh:
 With the AWS CLI With kubectl via CRDs  For this tutorial, we&amp;rsquo;ll use kubectl to define the App Mesh components.
To do this, we&amp;rsquo;ll add Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), and the App Mesh controller logic that syncs our kubernetes cluster&amp;rsquo;s CRD state with the AWS cloud-side App Mesh control plane.
To add the CRDs, from the repository base directory, execute the following commands:</description>

      <description>Congratulations on deploying the App Mesh Components!
Now that we have our App Mesh components created, we&amp;rsquo;ll introduce observability, analytics, and routing functionality into our DJ App by porting it to run on top of an App Mesh service mesh.</description>
